# TRS-rs232-PAK

A Tandy FD-501-style shell for Ian Mavric's reproduction of the Deluxe RS-232 Pak for the Tandy Color Computer series of systems.  This is actually a modification of *Brenda Make*'s design on Thingiverse, called *Handy Color Computer CoCo SDC FD-501 Style Case*.  You can find it here:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880775.

## Changes To The Original Design

I made four main changes:

1. Hollowed out the end of the enclouse where the SD card slot and LED were, making it one large open retangular area for the RS-232 connector.
2. Shortened the overall length by ~11 mm.
3. The card mount slots were widened some, as the RS-232 Pak reproduction is wider than the CoCo SDC the case was originally designed to accommodate.
4. Widened the card opening of the end-cap to accommodate the wider card.

## Use

There are two STL files here:

- One for the case itself - **enclosure.stl**
- One for the end-cap that holds the card in place - **endcap.stl**.  You'll need to provide your own screws to hold the end-cap in place.  

If you're using slicing software such as UltiMaker Cura, you can slice it so that both files can be printed at the same time.

## Wish-List (a.k.a Issues)

If I were to improve it, I would:

- Possibly shorten it another mm or two in length to make it a perfect fit for the length of the card.
- Make the opening for the RS-232 port the same shape and dimensions as the port, so it looks pretty.
- Actually make a label.

## Support

There is none.  Feel free to let me know if there are major issues, but I'm not an engineer by trade and honestly am susceptible to "New Shiny Object Syndrome", so whether or not I address any issues is a coin-flip.  That's the beauty of open-source; anyone can make it better.
