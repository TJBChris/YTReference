# RadioShackSign

Make your own Radio Shack sign in the font of the 70s-90s logo (the only correct logo in my mind).  For this project, it's all in the slicing...you can create solid letters, hollow ones, or whatever you like!  The example below will cover printing hollow letters with no backing.  Naturally, the specific steps will vary on your slicing software.  I used OrcaSlicer.

## Required Materials

The following materials are required:

- A 3D printer or access to a 3D printing service such as CraftCloud or ShapeWays.  I used my own 3D printer, a **Bambu Labs X1 Carbon**.
- Filament.  I use the following filament:
    - Badge: **Hatchbox 3D PLA** Printer Filament - Red - **P/N: 3D PLAP-1KG1.75-RED**

## Printing the letters

Depending on the size of your letters, you can probably combine two or more in one job.  

* Filament temperature: 205 C
* Heated bed: "Cool Plate" PLA plate, temp: 35 C.  I used a Glue Stick, as is recommended.
* Supports: Off
* First Layer Print Speed: 30 mm/s.
* All other layers: 50 mm/s.
* Travel speed: 100 mm/s.

If you want hollow letters with no backing (for a lighted sign, perhaps), your high-level steps are:

1. Create a new project in your slicer.
1. Flip the letters 180 degrees on the Z axis (so the faces of the letters are on the print bed).
1. Magnify the length and width letters to your desired size.  I streched mine to 500% of their original size.
1. Adjust the height as well...I used 50 mm.
1. Set the infill to None (0%).
1. Adjust your wall thickness as-desired.  I used 2 mm.
1. Slice.
1. Print.
1. Rinse, lather and repeat for the remaining letters.

Remember to print the 'a' twice.

## Enjoy!

That's it!  Enjoy your cool new Radio Shack sign.
