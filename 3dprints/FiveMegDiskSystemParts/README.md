# Five Meg Disk System Parts

In this directory you'll find chassis parts I make for the TRS-80/Tandy Five, Twelve, Fifteen, and Thirty-Five Meg disk system chassis/enclosures.

## Use

The STL file(s) here are as follows:

- A DB-25-sized cover for the Control Out port on the back of the Five Meg Disk System (and others).  You may find this port missing on some systems.   - **Control Out Port Cover.stl**

## Support

There is none.  Feel free to let me know if there are major issues, but I'm not an engineer by trade and honestly am susceptible to "New Shiny Object Syndrome", so whether or not I address any issues is a coin-flip.  That's the beauty of open-source; anyone can make it better.
