# TRS80XmasOrnament

This is a Christmas Ornament I designed based on the vintage TRS-80 nameplates used on earlier TRS-80 systems.  Its size and layout is based on that of the TRS-80 Model II/16 nameplates.

## Required Materials

The following materials are required:

- A 3D printer or access to a 3D printing service such as CraftCloud or ShapeWays.  I used my own 3D printer, a **Bambu Labs X1 Carbon**.
- Filament.  I use the following filament:
    - Badge: **Hatchbox 3D PLA** Printer Filament - True Black - **P/N: 3D PLA-1KG1.75-BLK**
- Paint: DeccoArt Shimmering Silver (**DAO70**)

## Printing the Badge

The badge can be found in **TRS80XmasOrnament.stl**.

The badge is the most difficult item to print.  You will want to turn down the printing speed on all layers.  I tended to keep the filament temperature on the lower end of its range to help it cool and harden faster.  Your results will vary wildly depending on your printer and how much you pray.  I used the following settings:

* Filament temperature: 180 C
* Heated bed: "Cool Plate" PLA plate, temp: 35 C.  I used a Glue Stick, as is recommended.
* Supports: Off
* First Layer Print Speed: 30 mm/s.
* All other layers: 50 mm/s.
* Travel speed: 100 mm/s.

After printing, use care not to bend the badge as you remove it.  It will bend or break easily.  

## Prepping and Painting the Badge

Once you've printed the badge, you'll want to remove any leftover PLA threads from the badge.  The easiest way to do this is to use a lighter.  While holding the badge upside down, kiss it with the flame of a lighter briefly from one side to the other.  It should only take one pass.  Do not stop or move too slowly; the badge will warp quickly.

To paint the badge, I do the following: 
1. Take a paper towel and fold it in half.  Once done, fold it over itself one more time (giving you four layers of paper towel).
1. Using a popscicle stick, spread a layer of the Shimmering Silver paint (DAO70) across the paper towel, covering an area just larger than the badge itself.
1. Spread and press in the paint with the popscicle stick until there are no drops or raised areas.  You want to keep the paper towel as flat as possible while avoiding pooling of the paint. 
1. Place the badge face-down on the painted section of the paper towel. 
1. Lightly press, gently rocking the badge in the paint.
1. Remove the badge, and set it on its back while the first coat of paint dries.  Use care not to touch the inside of the badge with your fingertips to avoid getting paint in the lower portion.
1. Repeat the painting process until the paint looks even and is coated to your preference.
1. After the top dries, you can apply the same paint to the sides of the badge using a foam brush.  Be sure to put a minimal amount on the brush to prevent the paint from forming drops or getting into the top of the badge where it's not wanted.
1. Enjoy your creation!
