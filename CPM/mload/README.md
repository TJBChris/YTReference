# YTReference/CPM/mload

This space contains files related to mload for CP/M.  It contains files referenced in a three-part series I did on YouTube.  Part I can be found here: https://youtu.be/I-Yav4NOcyg  That series of videos serves as documentation for these files.

PIP this file over to your target system via the serial port.  It can then be converted into an executable using HEXCOM.COM.

There are two files here:

* mload.hex: Original version with UNIX-style line breaks (0x0a)
* mload.txt: Converted version of mload.hex with CP/M-style line breaks (0x0d 0x0a)

Raw files can be found here (unmolested by me) can be found here:
