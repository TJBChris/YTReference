# 3dprints - 3D-Printable Parts

This space contains my (crudely) modified-and-or-designed 3D printable parts.  I'm new to this (as of 5/2023, when this first appeared), so if you expect anything other than barely-functional crap, your expectations are too high.  Feel free to improve upon any of these designs and either commit them back via a Pull request or whatnot.  Just give credit where it's due (either to me, the original designer, or both).

Each project has its own folder.  Where the base design is just someone else's and I've modified it, the appropriate credit and license will be provided within the project folder.  I'll also try to include a list of modifications made.  If it's my design, I'll so-note and also include license info.

## Support

There is none.  Feel free to let me know if there are major issues, but I'm not an engineer by trade and honestly am susceptible to "New Shiny Object Syndrome", so whether or not I address anything here is a coin-flip.  That's the beauty of open-source; anyone can make it better.

Honestly, for those designs where I've modified someone else's design, you're probably better off working off of their original if you want to modify it rather than bodging my already-bodgy work.

## Projects

- **TRS-rs232-PAK** - A Tandy FD-502-style shell for Ian Mavric's reproduction of the Deluxe RS-232 Pak for the Tandy Color Computer series of systems.  This is actually a modification of *Brenda Make*'s design on Thingiverse, called *Handy Color Computer CoCo SDC FD-501 Style Case*.  You can find it here:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880775.
