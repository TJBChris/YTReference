# YTReference/CPM/mload

This space contains files related to Kermit for CP/M, specifically Radio Shack CP/M Plus 3.0 for the TRS-80 Model II line of systems.  It contains files referenced in a three-part series I did on YouTube.  Part I can be found here: https://youtu.be/I-Yav4NOcyg  That series of videos serves as documentation for these files.

PIP the smaller letter-suffixed cspker?.hex files, along with cpvcp3.hex over to your target system via the serial port.  They can then be combined into an executable using MLOAD.  For other CP/M platforms, you'll replace cpvcp3.hex with a version specific to your platform.

The number-suffixed cspker?.hex files are the original files unmolested by me.  The letter-suffixed versions are smaller (to ensure they make it to the other side intact).

Raw files can be found here (unmolested by me) can be found here:
